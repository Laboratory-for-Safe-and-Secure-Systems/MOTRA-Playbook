# MOTRA-Playbook
MOTRA Playbook is our collection of tools, packages and vulnerabilities we found online during our research. We packaged all the tools into a custom container so we can run different payloads from different devices in a similar manner.

Playbook can be built from the command line using docker build or a compose file. Usage is similar to docker one shot containers. For the data capturing process, the current version of Playbook can also be used as a payload for MOTRA Capture to run preconfigured attacks on different targets inside the testbed.
